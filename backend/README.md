## Project Description
The backend for **MERNCrudWorkout** is a RESTful API designed to manage workouts, allowing users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on workout data. This API uses MongoDB for data storage, Express as the framework, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete workouts
- Data validation and error handling
- Modular code structure for scalability
- Simple and flexible API design

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** - Server runtime
- **Express** - Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** - ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB
- **Nodemon** - For automatically restarting the server during development

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MERNCrudWorkout-backend.git
   cd MERNCrudWorkout-backend
    ```
2. Install dependecies (first move to 'backend' folder):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the server
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The backend will be running on http://localhost:4200.
